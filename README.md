## What is Autograder? 
Autograder is a REACT based application. The application was developed over the course of two semesters in partnership with a professor at the team's university. Faced with the discontinuation of Mimir - a website that professors used to grade coding assignments for freshman - the professors teaching introductory computing classes needed a solution. After interviews, a completed vision document and software requirements specification document were completed the team was able to deliver a solution, Autograder. 

## Who is behind Autograder? 
Three developers worked on Autograder throughout the year. Amber Kusma, Emily Balboni, and Chris Rocco. Specifically, the backend was completed by Amber Kusma and Emily Balboni while Chris Rocco worked exclusively on the frontend.
